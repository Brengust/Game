    the recent technological innovations of war, and make known their dominance. But, as with\n
    the creation of tools of destruction comes the naivet√© of man. So prone is man to the\n
    belief that one can safely harness a destructive power against another, with little fear of the\n
    repercussions. The Miasma Expansion of 1915 marked the fall of humanity, a testament to the\n
    foolishness of man. Yet, still some cling to life, and even still whispers of hope can become\n
    heard through the streets. Even without king or country, humans still find the need to\n
